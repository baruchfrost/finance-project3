    This view shows the relationships between the Fed Funds rate (the rate at which banks in the US lend money to each other overnight), 
    the 10 year treasury bond rate, and the U3 unemployment rate from Aug 2006 to Feb 2023. There is strong correlation between the unemployment
    rate and the 10-year treasury bond rate and a strong negative correlation between these two rates and the Fed Funds rate.
